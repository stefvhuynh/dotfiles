Automator and AppleScript
-------------------------
You can create Automator workflows to launch applications or bring them to the
forefront. You can then assign the workflow to a global hotkey. This is useful
for quickly switching between apps you are using for development. An obvious
candidate would be to switch focus between iTerm2, Chrome, and mobile device
simulators. Additionally, you can use automator to run AppleScripts for more
complex tasks, which you can then run with a global hotkey. An obvious candidate
for a more complex task would be to launch all applications needed for
development and configure them as needed (you can even run terminal commands).
